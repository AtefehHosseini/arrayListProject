# ArrayList Operations in Java

**Description**

The `App.java` file contains a simple Java program that showcases the use of an ArrayList, a part of the Java Collections framework. It performs various operations like adding elements, removing elements, finding index, checking element existence, finding the size of the list, and converting the list to an array.

**Operations Covered**

1. **Adding elements to the list**: Demonstrates adding elements (10, 20, 30) to the ArrayList.
2. **Removing an element from the list**: Removes an element (20) from the list.
3. **Finding the index of an element**: Finds the index of a specific element (30) in the list.
4. **Checking element existence**: Checks if a specific element (40) exists in the list.
5. **Finding the size of the list**: Determines the number of elements in the list.
6. **Converting the list to an array**: Demonstrates converting the ArrayList to an array.

**Instructions**

To run this Java code:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Download the `App.java` file.
3. Compile the code by running: `javac App.java`.
4. Run the compiled code using: `java App`.
